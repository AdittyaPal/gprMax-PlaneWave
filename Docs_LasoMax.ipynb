    "### Importing Geometrical Information from Laser Scanners-\n",
    "\n",
    "The module focuses on the ability to directly model real objects without having to enter their geometries manually. A laser scanner takes distance measurements in every direction to rapidly capture the surface shape of objects, buildings and landscapes.The data acquired from the laser scanner is in the form of point cloud. This information is then used to construct a full 3D model of the object in the form of a STL mesh. The point cloud data can be processed through various free mesh processing softwares (for example, MeshLab) to be converted into STL format. The STL mesh is then voxelized. A voxel is a unit of graphic information that defines a point in three-dimensional space. The voxelized model array is further used to build FDTD cells upon which gprMax is based. "

    "This function allows the user to convert the STL models to voxelized mesh. The input parameter requires the user to specify the path of the STL file, a material index (an integer corresponding to the materials given in the materials.txt file that you want the model to be built of) and also the spacial discretization/resolution of the model.\n",

    "Usage:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "g_stl = gprMax.GeometryObjectsReadSTL(stl_file='your_model_file.stl', mat_index = n, discretization=(0.002,0.002,0.002))\n",

    "#### NOTE:\n",
    " - Before using this module make sure that your conda env has 'numpy-stl' pip dependency installed. You can check that by running 'conda list'. If not installed, then head over to the conda_env.yml file, under the pip section add 'numpy-stl' and rebuild the environment by using the following command\n",

    "#### Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Resolution is basically the no. of layers in which the model is divided. It can have different values for each axis, and these values are auto-calculated based on the spacial discretization entered by the user. A simple relation follows: smaller the spacial discretization, greater would be the resolution, thus greater would be the no. of voxels.\n",
